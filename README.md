# Installation
## Mac OS X (not yet working)
A copy of db2 Express-C v10.1 for Mac OS X can be found in: db2/express-c/db2_express-c_v10.1_osx  

**Setup - via wizard**  
1. execute db2setup (db2/express-c/db2_express-c_v10.1_osx/expc/db2setup)  

For some reason i was not capable of getting the db2 to install using the normal setup.  
After launching it i got following error output:  

<code>DBI1190I  db2setup is preparing the DB2 Setup wizard which will guide you through the program setup process.</code>   <code>Please wait.</code>  
<code>.../ibm-db2/db2/express-c/db2_express-c_v10.1_osx/expc/db2/macos/install/db2setup: line 606:</code>   <code>/tmp/db2_seriousbusiness.tmp.48706/db2/macos/install/../java/jre/bin/java:</code>  
<code>No such file or directory</code>  
<code>DBI1160I  Non-root install is being performed.</code>  

<code>You are using a Java(TM) Runtime Environment that has not been officially tested for use with DB2.</code>  
<code>This command will continue to execute, however if you experience problems,</code>  
<code>refer to the DB2 installation documentation for a list of supported environments.</code>

I tried to change my java version to 1.6 instead of 1.7 but it didn't help.

Find the Java Home of a java version:  
terminal command: /usr/libexec/java_home -v version-number  
example: /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.6  
example: /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.7  

**Alternative - via terminal**  
1. become administrator using sudo su 
2. execute db2_install (default install folder: /opt/IBM/db2/V10.1)  
3. create an instance, execute db2icrt <instance-name>  
  - /opt/IBM/db2/V10.1/instance/db2icrt testdb2 (the instance name can only have a max of 8 characters)
