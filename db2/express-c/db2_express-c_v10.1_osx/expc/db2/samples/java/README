* README for Java Sample Install Client
*
* Last update: April 2006
*
* The db2/samples/java directory contains this README file and a 
* Java program InstallTester.java.  The program InstallTester.java is used to 
* run the DB2 install process through an external client.
*
* This README file describes the sample files in the directory.  It is
* recommended that you copy the files from the directory to your working
* directory prior to building the sample program.
*
* To build and run the DB2 Java sample program under the db2/samples/java 
* directory, you must have Java SDK 1.4.x or above installed.
*
*****************************************************************************
*
* MESSAGE PROTOCOL
* 
* The sample program shows how to handle messages sent out in 
* machine-readable format.  
*
* For more information on the message protocol used by the installer,
* please refer to the documentation located at:
*
* http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9/topic/com.ibm.db2.udb.uprun.doc/doc/t0023996.htm
*

*
*     QUICKSTART
*
*  1) Copy db2/samples/java/* to a working directory
*
*  2) If you have a compatible make program on your system, you can use the
*     makefile provided.  Modify the Makefile to reflect your environment.
*
*     Execute 'make' in your working directory.
*
*     Note:
*       The makefile provided will only work if a compatible make executable
*       program is resident on your system in a directory included in your
*       PATH variable.  Such a make utility may be provided by another 
*       language compiler.
*
*  3) If you do not have a compatible make utility, you cannot use the 
*     makefile.
*     You can use the javac bytecode compiler to build the sample program.
*
*     To build the program without a compatible make utility:
*
*       javac <program name>.java
*
*     To build everything in the working directory:
*
*       javac *.java
*
*  3) Modify the response file to contain the following keyword:
*     OUTPUT_STREAM_TYPE = MACHINE
*
*  4) Start the DB2 installation using the sample program with the following
*     command:
*
*    java InstallTester <location of db2setup> -r <location of response file>
*
